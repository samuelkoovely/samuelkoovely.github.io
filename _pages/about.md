I am a doctoral student in the group of <a href="https://alexbovet.github.io/">Prof. Dr. Alexandre Bovet</a>, at the Department of Mathematical Modeling and Machine Learning of the University of Zurich (see <a href="https://dm3l.uzh.ch/about-us/members/person?pId=33328">here</a>).
I work on various aspects of complex network theory. Currently, I am studying diffusion processes over graphs and using tools from information theory to understand the structural properties of complex networks.
Moreover, I am interested in topics at the intersection of probability theory and statistics; in particular Markov processes, graphical models, machine learning, and causal inference.
