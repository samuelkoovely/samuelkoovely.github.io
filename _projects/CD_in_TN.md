I am developing new tools based on the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abj3063"> flow stability method </a> for community detection in non stationary networks. Moreover, I am contributing to the refinement of the code of the <a href="https://github.com/alexbovet/flow_stability"> flow stability project </a>.
