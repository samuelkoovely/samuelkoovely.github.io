Markov models are a foundational concept in probability theory and offer insights into systems that evolve over time, making them vital in diverse fields like statistics, computer science, biology, and economics. \\
This seminar consists of an exploration of a wide array of Markov models and their applications, including discrete-time and continuous-time Markov chains, Bayesian networks, Markov random fields, hidden Markov models, Markov decision processes, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

The plan of the talks goes as follows:
