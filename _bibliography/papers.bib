  abstract={T-cells are a core component of the adaptive immune system: they play a major role in mounting an effective and tailored response to foreign pathogens, and they are also relevant in the context of cancer and cer- tain autoimmune diseases.
T-cells receptors are protein complexes present on T-cells’ surface that are responsible for identifying foreign and own antigens. Given the complexity of protein-protein interactions, this identification process exhibits a quasi-stochastic behaviour that can be modeled with probabilistic and statistical models.
Graphical models can represent a multivariate distribution in a convenient and transparent way as a graph. In this paper we introduce COMIC-Tree, an undirected graphical model for protein-protein interactions, and DrawCOMIC-Tree, a greedy algorithm based on conditional mutual information for learning COMIC-Tree structures. We provide a solid mathematical foundation for them, highlight some theoretical aspects, and test them empirically on a dataset of T-cell receptors.}

  type={Semester Paper},

  abstract={The output of the original PC-algorithm depends on the order of the evaluated variables, and the separating sets used during its pruning process might
be inconsistent with the final result. We give an overview of some variations of this method that address these shortcomings and perform a simulationstudy of these algorithms.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
